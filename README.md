## Problem Statement

This dashboard shows the relationship between delivery times and  agent ratings or delivery area. It helps you find out whether delivery time is directly related to customer satisfaction and the average delivery time to each area. It also lets you know the average delivery time (125 h) and the average rating of couriers (4,63).

You can also compare results by the type of vehicle used for delivery.
